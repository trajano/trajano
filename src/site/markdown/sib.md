Standards Information Base (SIB)
================================

The [Standards Information Base or SIB][Standards Information Base] is a
database of facts and guidance about information systems standards.  It
details the components used to implement a [technical reference model][].
To keep things simple, the SIB is used to list the technologies being used
by the organization for the purpose of delivery.

This [SIB][Standards Information Base] specifically documents the ones used by the [open source contributions][4] of the organization.  Though they are built and deployed from within the confines of the organization, cloud service tooling is heavily used to allow access to the greater community.

* [GitHub][] is used for [issue tracking][] and the [source repository][].
* [Travis][] is used as a [continuous integration][] and however as of trajano-17 it no longer does the [release process](release-process.html).
* [Jenkins][] is used for the continuous release and is managed within the organization.
* [SonarQube][] is used for [quality management][3], but because the rules cannot be configured the results on [SonarCloud.io][] are ignored by the organization.
* [Sonatype OSS][] is used as the repository as it provides a freely available Nexus server and provides [detailed instructions for promoting up to Maven Central][2].
