Trajano
=======

[Trajano][] is an IT Consulting/Contracting delivery organization specialising
in end-to-end enterprise architecture, systems design and development.  It is 
founded by [Archimedes Trajano][1] [[LinkedIn][LinkedIn]]
[[StackOverflow][StackOverflow]].
	
### About this project

This project provides the [Trajano][] organizational POM.  In this project, 
the [services used][2], [overall reports][4], [core plug-ins][3] and [managed
plugin versions][5] are specified along with branding details.  In a way 
this codifies the [Standards Information Base][2] for the organization.

### Coding standards

[Coding standards][6] are referenced on this plugin to define the rulesets that
are used by [Checkstyle][], [PMD][PMD], [FindBugs][FindBugs] and
[m2e codestyle][m2e] Maven plugins.  The activation of these plugins are done
on individual projects and not on this level.

### Versioning

The organizational POM version numbering scheme is a single numeric number. This
is similar to the way [Apache][] does their POM versioning.  The only exception
is when there is a build issue, but the core plugin versions and configurations
have not changed and it had already been released to central.
